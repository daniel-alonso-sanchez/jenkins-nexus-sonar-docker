# jenkins-nexus-sonar-docker

This is my first try to build a docker set of containers, in order to achieve CI platform.

It use jenkins, sonar and nexus and it is ready to launch behind a corporate proxy.

Still there are some things to be changed, like adding some volumes for nexus and sonar database, for example.
